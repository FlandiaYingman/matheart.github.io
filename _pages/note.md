## Note
- **[Ongoing]** [**Theory of scaling law**](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zryqvydkkmth#2513bf)
<br /> Understanding model's performance when the model and data size scale up (i.e. Scaling law) is a critical topic in both academia and industry. Therefore, I believe that understanding the scaling law in a simplified theoretical setup will become very important. 

- **[Ongoing]** [**Mechanistic Interpretability**](https://www.overleaf.com/read/svcdvthkbqqd#906f50)
<br /> 
In my opinion, mechanistic interpretability tools would be one of the promising routes to demystify the mechanisms of neural network and LLM.

I plan to understand deep learning phenomena using both theoretical and empirical toolsets above during my PhD studies, welcome discussions and contributions on the note above! Here is also an [interesting repository](https://github.com/MinghuiChen43/awesome-deep-phenomena).

<br /> CS552 Modern NLP (Graduate-level)
It is an interesting experience since it was my first time to implement something related to LLM. Also intriguingly, we discovered both chosen and reject reward decrease at the same time in section 5.2, which echos discussions on drawbacks of DPO.

We discovered that many theory literature on SAM assumes diminishing radius, therefore, in this project, we explored how radius, norm of the ball and the normalization affect generalization performance.
