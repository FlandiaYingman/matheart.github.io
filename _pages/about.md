Hi! I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science & Mathematics in The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), I am now having academic exchange at EPFL.  My research interest lies in **providing theoretical foundations for modern deep learning algorithms to gain more understandings of their practical achievements**. Recently, I am working on understanding in-context learning mechanism and I am also interested in diving into deep neural networks by empirical investigations like using mechanistic interpretability approaches. I am interested in applying for PhD position in 2025 Fall. Feel free to connect if you have similar research interest with me!


I am very fortunate to work with [Wei Hu](https://weihu.me/) @ Michigan and [Yiping Lu](https://2prime.github.io/) @ Northwestern. And I am very grateful to [Tong Zhang](https://tongzhang-ml.org/) @ HKUST for giving me opportunity to begin my research journey in Year 2 Fall.


I am maintaining a [Bilibili account](https://space.bilibili.com/346660989) for introducing interesting concepts in Computer Science or Mathematics using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), and I also have a [Zhihu account](https://www.zhihu.com/people/theorywanderer) for sharing and discussing my opinions and ideas with peers.
