Hi! I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science & Mathematics in The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research interest lies in **deep learning theory**, providing theoretical foundations for modern deep learning algorithms to better understand why they work. Recently, I’ve been working in a clean and controlled setting to empirically investigate how large language models (LLMs) work. I’m also interested in the theory of scaling law. I’ve written some notes on what I’ve learned, so feel free to check them out!


I am interested in applying for PhD position in Computer Science / Statistics / Operations Research starting in 2025 Fall, and I like chatting with like-minded people so feel free to connect if you share similar research interest with me!


I am very fortunate to be mentored by [Wei Hu](https://weihu.me/) at Michigan and [Yiping Lu](https://2prime.github.io/) at Northwestern. I am also very grateful to [Tong Zhang](https://tongzhang-ml.org/) (previously at HKUST) for giving me opportunity to start my research in my sophomore year.
