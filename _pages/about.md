Hi! I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science & Mathematics in The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research interest lies in **building mathematical theory to understand and explain behaviors of modern deep learning algorithms and LLM**. Empirically I am also interested in **understanding LLM's behavior in a simplified setup via mechanistic interpretability methods**. I believe these two approaches are crucial to open the black box of deep learning architecture.


I am interested in applying for PhD position in Computer Science / Statistics / Operations Research starting in 2025 Fall, and I like chatting with like-minded people so feel free to connect if you share similar research interest with me!


I am very fortunate to be mentored by [Wei Hu](https://weihu.me/) at Michigan and [Yiping Lu](https://2prime.github.io/) at Northwestern who always provide support and suggestions academically and personally. I am also very grateful to [Tong Zhang](https://tongzhang-ml.org/) (previously at HKUST) who led me to the awesome learning theory world in my sophomore year. I am also very glad to receive support from many seniors and peers who help me navigate challenges and shape my research taste (see [friend link](https://matheart.github.io/friend_link/))!

  * [Paper accepted to ICLR2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17230) as coauthor
  * This work has an interesting finding that ensemble of models with spurious features can improve its performance, which is contrary to common belief on OOD that models should maintain invariant features and disgard spurious features like IRM.
