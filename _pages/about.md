Hi! I am a third-year student majoring in Computer Science & Mathematics in The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I am very fortunate to work with [Yiping Lu](https://2prime.github.io/) at Northwestern. Previously, I was supervised by [Tong Zhang](https://tongzhang-ml.org/) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I will conduct summer research under the guidence of [Wei Hu](https://weihu.me/) at University of Michigan.

My research interest lies in **providing theoretical foundations for modern deep learning algorithms to gain more understandings of their practical achievements**. I am also interested in diving into deep neural networks by empirical investigations like using mechanistic interpretability approaches. Recently, I am working on in-context learning. I believe that theory without practice is empty, but equally, practice without theory is blind. Feel free to connect if you have similar research interest with me!

I am maintaining a [Bilibili account](https://space.bilibili.com/346660989) for introducing interesting concepts in Computer Science or Mathematics using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), and I also have a [Zhihu account](https://www.zhihu.com/people/theorywanderer) for sharing and discussing my opinions and ideas with peers.
