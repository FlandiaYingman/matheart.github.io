title: "Spurious Feature Diversification Improves Out-of-distribution
Generalization"
collection: publications
permalink: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17230
excerpt: 'Contrary to the traditional belief that emphasizes the exclusive learning of invariant features for OOD, we found that incorporating diverse spurious features (referred as spurious feature diversification) weakens their individual contributions, leading to improved overall OOD generalization performance.'
